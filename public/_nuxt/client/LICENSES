/**

 *
 * @author CodeX <team@codex.so>
 * @license MIT
 * @see {@link https://github.com/editor-js/image}
 *
 * To developers.
 * To simplify Tool structure, we split it to 4 parts:
 *  1) index.js — main Tool's interface, public API and methods for working with data
 *  2) uploader.js — module that has methods for sending files via AJAX: from device, by URL or File pasting
 *  3) ui.js — module for UI manipulations: render, showing preloader, etc
 *  4) tunes.js — working with Block Tunes: render buttons, handle clicks
 *
 * For debug purposes there is a testing server
 * that can save uploaded files and return a Response {@link UploadResponseFormat}
 *
 *       $ node dev/server.js
 *
 * It will expose 8008 port, so you can pass http://localhost:8008 with the Tools config:
 *
 * image: {
 *   class: ImageTool,
 *   config: {
 *     endpoints: {
 *       byFile: 'http://localhost:8008/uploadFile',
 *       byUrl: 'http://localhost:8008/fetchUrl',
 *     }
 *   },
 * },
